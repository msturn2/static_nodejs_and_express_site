# *Static Node.js and Express Site*
------



A portfolio app that displays my Treehouse Projects.  Using Express and Node.js, I built an app to showcase my JavaScript, CSS, HTML, NPM, PUG, Express and Node.js prowess to potential employers.

- Separated app into modules for scalability
- Used PUG templating to minimize code
- User friendly error message handling
- Customized styling to give the app my own personal touches
  - Changed font of h and p tags to Chaparral from Merriweather
  - Added growing hover effect to project thumbnails
  - Added background-color change of buttons on hover
  - Added transition from grayscale to color on project landscape images on hover
